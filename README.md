<h1>Simple Port Scanner Script</h1>

### [Project Walkthrough]([https://kmac907.tech/](https://kmac907.tech/index.php/2022/10/21/creating-a-simple-port-scanner-w-python/))

<h2>Description</h2>
As I study for the Network+ tools like Nmap and Wireshark come up a lot. As a way to expand my knowledge. I figured it would be a good idea to build my own port scanner in python. But firstly, what is a port scanner? A port scanner is simply a tool that can scan and find open ports on a given network. Security engineers use it to scan computers for vulnerabilities, and hackers use it to target victims. A detailed walkthrough can be found on my portfolio(linked above). Where I document the projects that I do. The file for the Python script is attached to this repository.
